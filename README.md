# Physarum-Ai


This minimal benchmark assesses AI models' ability to predict Physarum polycephalum (slime mold) navigation and network formation. 
It includes:      
  Dataset: Time-lapse in a petri dish with oat
  Metrics: Path accuracy, time-to-solution, branching pattern similarity   
  Challenge: Predict optimal nutrient network formation with and without obstacles 
Models must forecast 60-minute growth from 10-minute initial observations. The benchmark evaluates biological simulation accuracy with minimal computational requirements.
